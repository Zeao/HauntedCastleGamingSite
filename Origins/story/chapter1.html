			<h3>Chapter 1: Aura</h3>
			<p>"They say, that this world knows you better than you know yourself. Aura is its proof. Aura unites us. Aura divides us. Aura speaks the language of the soul."</p>
			<p>When the world was new, Aura was in abundance. It flowed through the land, and nourished all life. Because of its colour and form, no one even knew there was a difference between this magical liquid and water. However, that was before the Great Divide.</p>
			<p>Shortly after civilizations were formed and governments were established, people started noticing something strange happening to the water. At first it was subtle. There was a small hint of colour, or it rippled a little different than normal. Then the colours became more vibrant. People were walking into lakes and turning it into vibrant hues of red, green, blue and all the other colours of the rainbow. The strangest was when the water started to change densities.</p>
			<p>The reports were astonishing. People drinking a glass of water and blowing out steam. Or skimming their hands against the lake's surface and creating shimmering gem stones.</p>
			<p>As societies grew more defined and political factions formed, the accounts of these stories became more unique. The began to notice the difference between water that caused these interesting events, and the water that did not. They called this new substance “Aura”.</p>
			<p>These days were the happiest and most intriguing.</p>
			<p>But it wasn't long lived. As these fables intensified, the societies started turning on one another, dividing themselves on how each person interacted with Aura. They started finding out that those who shape Aura in similar ways also have similar views on politics, beliefs, and even pastimes. The divisions grew deeper,and the hatred became more intense.</p>
			<p>This was the beginning of the Great Divide.</p>
			<p>The Five Factions were formed around Aura. The Test was created and regulated to determine a person's Factions. It was a known fact that on the 16th birthday, when a sentient being touched Aura, the Aura would react.</p>
			<p>At first there was a belief that the alliances should be formed on the colour that the Aura turned into. This was a false belief, because though two people could turn Aura into the same colour, they did not always have anything in common. There was one truth though, Aura never stayed completely clear once there was a reaction.</p>
			<p>Then observations were made around the density categories Aura fell under. There were five known densities that Aura could fall under: it turned into a light cloud which floated above for a while; it could be a dense mist which settled; it would stay a liquid; it could be a malleable gel-like solid; finally, it could be a very dense rock.</p>
			<p>Life had become divided, and gone were those quiet days of peace, calm, and unity.</p>
			<p>Shortly after the division began the War. We should have all seen this happen. When you divide everyone on their beliefs, how could you not be surprised when hatred begins to towards the other groups?</p>
			<p>As the war raged on, weapons were formed. Swords, shields and axes were not uncommon anymore. Mythical weapons started to present themselves. However, the strongest of all weapons was the knowledge to manipulate Aura and turn it into the will of its controller.</p>
			<p>This all began with one man. His true name has been lost over the years, but is referenced in the lores of each Faction. The most common name has been translated to “The Seer”. His greatest realization was that if you concentrated on an image in your head as you interacted with Aura, then the Aura would listen and create that thing for you. At first it was simple, he made fire spark out of a pool of Aura. Then he created ice on the pool’s surface.He quickly began to push his limits. He fashioned thunder clouds out of the Aura. Then from those clouds he brought down lightning. Then he did the most remarkable thing -  he brought life out of the Aura.</p>
			<p>One day as the Seer was testing the limits of Aura, a roar erupted from the forest behind him. It was monstrous. Quickly after, the ground began to shake and he could hear terrified animals charging towards him. They were coming quickly. He knew that he had to run. But how? Running would be too slow. There was no way he was fast enough on his own. He needed a steed, something swift and powerful. He needed a horse as powerful and fast as a raging fire. Then, out of no where, a creature emerged from the Aura. A horse, pure white with a mane of tamed flames. It stood over the Seer with a noble and proud stance. The Seer quickly abandoned his awe, mounted the beast, and rode off.</p>
			<p>He could never have imagined how important this triumph would be on the future of his planet. He knew this would be a great enlightenment for all of the factions, but he did not think that this discovery would be used to amass armies of monstrous, dangerous, new creatures.</p>
			<p>The War intensified and multiplied as the armies grew in strength and size. The lands became soaked with blood as the monsters slaughtered each other, but none mourned over these losses. None beside the Seer. He saw that though these creatures fought side by side with their makers, they were considered expendable.</p>
			<p>Though none believed it, the inevitable happened. Aura started to deplete around the world. It was used in such abundance that the world could not recover it. Each army had to start to find a way to carry Aura from reservoirs over to the battlefields.  But as each person discovered, this was impossible.</p>
			<p>Jars and canisters were useless. The moment the Aura became disconnected from the world, it would transform into pure water. Refreshing, but useless. Then the idea of mixing it with dirt, and carrying this infused mud. But, for some reason, the mud would carry but the Aura would still become water in the end. And some of the times the mud would dry up and all they would have left was sand.</p>
			<p>At this point, the war started to calm down and the armies began to diminish. However, despite this, the hatred between the factions never receded. </p>
